- Fix serif font
- Implement standalone readability script
- Branch to new chrome app
	- Can probably open index.php (to be .html) as a new window with chrome API. App does not get injected into webpage, only toast does.
	- Don't need auto-save in the same sense anymore, no need to save previous sessions. Should however save settings to chrome app settings.
