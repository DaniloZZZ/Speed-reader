		<p>We've made Readio easy and intuitive to use, and we hope you like it. You will find quick access buttons in the bottom right corner of every page we detect is readable, with these buttons you can read the current page or open the text editor to paste your own text. You can always access these features in the browser toolbar as well, in case you have disabled the quick access feature or the current page isn't detected readable. Lastly, you can always select text on any page and right click it to speed read it.</p>
